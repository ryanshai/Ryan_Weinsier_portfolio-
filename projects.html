Process
             
              <br>
For this project, I started by downloading and setting up PrusaSlicer. Once the software was configured,
              I downloaded the provided nametag .3MF file and customized the text with my name. I experimented briefly with font sizes before choosing one that I liked. 
              I made sure to “slice” keep the color change feature active so the text would stand out once printed. After starting the print  I watched the process until the printer 
              signaled for the color change, and then I swapped the filament to get the two tone effect. Going over sections of the Prusa mini+ Handbook helped me better understand the filament loading process. 
              The workflow gave me useful experience in preparing a model in PrusaSlicer and carrying out a successful print to jump off from.

              <br>
              
              For my second print, I chose a castle-style torture test that featured tall towers and several steep overhangs. I deliberately sliced and printed it without supports to see how the Prusa MINI+ would handle challenging geometries. 
              The vertical walls and towers came out fairly accurate, but the unsupported overhangs failed, bridges sagged and collapsed, leaving rough edges and incomplete features. This showed me that while the printer can reproduce simple and vertical shapes well,
              it struggles with designs that include large spans or unsupported angles unless supports are added. It also highlighted the design-side limitation: just because a 3D model looks good in CAD does not mean it is practical to print without modification.

              <br>
              In terms of file types, the STL I downloaded contained only the raw geometry of the castle, which meant I had to set up all of the slicing parameters myself in PrusaSlicer. A 3MF file, by contrast, can save not only the model but also the print settings, color changes, 
              and other details, making it more useful for sharing ready-to-print projects.

              <br>
              For my open-source assistive device, I printed a tool designed to help hold a book open with one hand. The device fits over the thumb and uses two angled wings to press down the pages, making it easier to keep the book open without needing both hands.
              This design is especially useful for people with limited mobility, or for anyone who wants to comfortably read while using their other hand for something else.
              <br>
              <br>
              The print came out clean and functional on the first try. The documentation from Makers Making Change was clear and easy to follow, with well-prepared STL files and usage instructions. I found that the device worked as intended, though I noticed that the size 
              and angle could vary depending on the thickness of the book, something that might be improved by offering multiple size options or making the design adjustable. Overall, this project demonstrated how 3D printing can be used to quickly and inexpensively create
              personalized assistive tools that improve accessibility in everyday life.

  <h1>Project 2 – Remixing and Learning CAD Tools</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Part 1: CAD Orientation – Heart Ring Trays</h2>
    <p>
      To begin, I followed the Tinkercad tutorials through the <em>Diamond Ring</em> exercise. 
      This gave me a basic foundation in navigating the workspace, aligning shapes, and combining objects. 
      For my first original model, I created two small <strong>heart-shaped ring trays</strong>. 
      I designed them by starting with a heart shape, extruding it, and then hollowing out the middle so that 
      the center is lower than the walls. This design choice keeps rings or small jewelry pieces from sliding out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then recreated the same tray in <strong>Fusion 360</strong>, which required a different workflow: 
      sketching the heart outline, extruding, and then cutting out the center. Fusion felt more precise, but also 
      more complex — I had to learn constraints and sketches before I could replicate what was simple to 
      drag-and-drop in Tinkercad.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Part 2: Tinkercad Remix – Key Hanger</h2>
    <p>
      For my first remix, I downloaded a wall-mounted <strong>key hanger</strong> model. 
      My goal was to make it more practical for daily use. I made three changes:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Reduced the number of hooks to simplify the design.</li>
      <li>Deepened the hooks so that keys would not slip off.</li>
      <li>Added extra hooks along the platform top so I could hang additional items.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      After exporting the file, I brought it into <strong>Prusa Slicer</strong>, where I scaled it slightly 
      and oriented it flat against the build plate. I printed it in PLA at 0.2mm layer height and 15% infill. 
      The hooks printed well, but I noticed that the overhangs needed supports to come out clean. 
      In the future, I might redesign the hook angle to reduce reliance on supports.
    </p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Part 3: Fusion Remix – Hydroponic Planter</h2>
    <p>
      For my Fusion remix, I chose a <strong>small hydroponic planter</strong>. 
      I wanted to make it more compact, but still usable. I scaled the model down overall, 
      then enlarged the opening for pouring water so it would remain functional even at the smaller size. 
      This was easier to do in Fusion than Tinkercad because I could directly adjust dimensions and sketches 
      rather than just scale everything proportionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Prusa Slicer, I oriented the planter so the opening faced up and printed it at 0.2mm layer height, 
      20% infill, with supports inside the water channel. The print came out successfully, though the smaller 
      size meant the wall thickness was close to the nozzle diameter. If I were to redo it, I would thicken 
      the walls slightly in Fusion to make the print more durable.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Working with both <strong>Tinkercad</strong> and <strong>Fusion 360</strong> showed me how different CAD tools shape the design process. 
      Tinkercad was easy for quick edits and remixing models by combining or subtracting shapes, 
      but it felt limiting when I wanted precise control. Fusion was harder to learn, but once I understood 
      sketches and constraints, it gave me much finer control over dimensions and design adjustments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of printing, small changes in CAD made big differences in real-world usability: deepening hooks 
      kept keys from slipping, enlarging an opening kept the planter functional at a smaller scale, 
      and adding walls to trays kept rings from spilling. If I optimized these further, I would tweak wall 
      thicknesses and overhangs to reduce support material and improve durability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, I learned how important it is to think about the entire workflow: sketch → CAD → slicing → print. 
      Each step influenced the final object, and remixing let me take existing designs and adapt them to my needs.
